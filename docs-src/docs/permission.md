The **Easy Permission** module makes it easy to request for permissions during runtime. It can mark the any permission as madatory ifrequired, so that user will be promted for premission even if he denied the premission earlier. It also directes the user to the setting page so that he can eanable the permissions there. 

Whenever the user enables the permissions the callbacks will help the developer to continue with the pending operations if any. For example on a button click if user is asked to allow camera permision, and once the user allows the premission we can make the app directly go the camera operation instead of making the user to click the button once angain.
